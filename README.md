the big modpack

How to install:
1. close technic launhcer
2. put "the-1122-pack" folder into /AppData/Roaming/.technic/modpacks/
3. run technic launcher

wtf is this modpack? Well one day i woke up and wanted to play ftb revelations but i realised
i didnt have rftools... then i didnt have something else.... then another thing.... and i decided
that, that was the last straw, so i wanted to make a modpack, that basically has everything you
want from the biggest and best mods.

for now I have made a prototype using the 1.12.2 pack from technic as  a foundation. For now the
pack is alright its not perfect and it can be better obviously. My future plan is to build a
version using ftb revelations probably and after that creating a modpack from scratch doing
everything necceseray in minetweaker, oredict, bla bla you know how it is. That last one will
be great and awesome if it works, but it will take a tremendous amount of time.

So for now enjoy this project if you want, license is MIT meaning that you can do whatever
you want i dont care modify it, add it anywhere, use from it, sell it, of course any damage you do or
any authorities you get in your bussiness is your responsibility im not liable of anything.

I might also make links for the mods we will see.
